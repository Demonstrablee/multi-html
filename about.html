         <p> With Computer Science I strive to learn as much as I can about the technology that I've grown up with, understand how it 
            operates and try to get talk to others and hopefull get them intrested with it asewell. For me to be an engineer people dont
            have to just have an intrest in computers, the should probably have great desire to learn more and more about diffrent ways to 
            implement various things, striving to make projects that are effcient and great examples of the application of their knowledge.
