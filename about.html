         <p> With Computer Science I strive to learn as much as I can about the technology that I've grown up with, understand how it 
            operates and try to talk to others and hopefully get them interested with it as well. For me, to be an engineer people don't
            have to just have an interest in computers, they should probably have great desire to learn more about different ways to 
            implement various things, striving to make projects that are efficient and great examples of the application of their knowledge.
